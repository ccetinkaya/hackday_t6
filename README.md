Problem

The City of Lucerne would like to register how many people visiting cultural events in the City of Lucerne are actually residents of Lucerne and how many are visiting from the agglomeration (K5: Ebikon, Emmen, Horw, Kriens, City of Lucerne incl. Littau and Reussbühl) or even outside the Region. This information would be used by the City of Lucerne to discuss more accurately with the agglomeration, how much they have to pay to the city on cultural promotion.
Idea

At the entrance of the cultural events we would put a tablet where visitors are asked to insert the zip code of their home address. This would be a voluntary process and the visitors will be rewarded with a funny thank you note, once they put in the information. For the City of Lucerne a dashboard with visualisations of the visitor flow to the different cultural events can be created.
Goal

Create a prototype of a technical solution to count visitors of cultural events. What is the percentage of visitors from the city of Lucerne and the surrounding municipalities?
Data

There is no data which can be used as the goal of the challenge is to find a way of collecting the data.
